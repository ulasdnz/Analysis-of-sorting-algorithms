# Analysis Of Sorting Algorithms

The program doesnâ€™t read inputs from the file instead it creates them randomly at each execution.The inputs for this project have different sizes 
that are 10 thousand, 100 thousand and 1 million, and also have different characteristics such as random, sorted and unsorted. We sort these different types
of arrays by using the following algorithms and compare the results which you can see in the report.pdf file:

* Counting Sort
* Quick Sort
* Quick Sort (Median-of-3)
* Heap Sort
* Merge Sort
* Binary Insertion Sort
* Insertion Sort


### Usage

This project requires [node](http://nodejs.org). After downloading the nodejs, run the following command:
